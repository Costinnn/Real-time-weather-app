## Introduction - project's aim

This project was the starting point to my journey in better understanding how web applications are structured and work in a bigger picture. This was the transition point between static websites and fullstack applications. 

## Technologies

**React**

**HTML & SCSS**

**Javascript**

## What I learned?
This project helped me understand how can I use public APIs in an only front end application. Also I learned how to use, manipulate and display the data that I received from that API.

## Functionalities
By default when opening the app it gets weather data for Bucharest, but you can search for almost every city you want. The data displayed contains weather information for the current hour, and the following 24 hours in the hourly slide. Every hourly contains the temperature in celsius and a representative icon for the weather. You'll also get weather information for the next 3 days.

If the city introduced can't be found you'll get a message.
